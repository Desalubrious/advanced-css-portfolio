# advanced-css-portfolio

# 01: Objective
My objective with this assignment was to create a website that contains my portfolio, information about me, and contact information to assist perspective employers in familiarizing themselves with who I am as a developer.

# 02: Execution
I used my knowledge of advanced CSS and HTML techniques to create a responsive website that met the following criteria:
```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```
